ðŸš€ Project Showcase: OTP Verification System with Frontend & Backend Simulation ðŸš€

I am excited to share a recent project that Iâ€™ve been working onâ€”a comprehensive OTP Verification System that seamlessly integrates frontend and backend functionalities.

Project Overview:
This project is a practical demonstration of OTP (One-Time Password) verification, designed to enhance user authentication and security. It incorporates a simulated backend using JavaScriptâ€™s localStorage for temporary data storage and validation, offering a robust solution for validating user inputs.

Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Category Selection: Users can choose from three categories for OTP deliveryâ€”Phone, Email, or Username.

ðŸ”¹ OTP Generation & Storage: Implemented an OTP generation function and stored the OTP data in the browser's localStorage, simulating a backend service.

ðŸ”¹ OTP Expiry Management: The system ensures that OTPs are time-sensitive, automatically expiring after a set period (2 minutes) to enhance security.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Validation: On the frontend, users enter the OTP they receive, and the system verifies it against the stored value, providing immediate feedback.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS (including hover effects), and JavaScript.
Backend Simulation: JavaScript localStorage for storing and validating OTPs.
